### Customer responsibilities

As a valued customer of the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform, we request your acknowledgment of the following responsibilities to ensure the continued security, performance, and efficiency of the service:

##### **Security Management**

* **Device security:** While the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform provides robust security measures, the customer is responsible for the security of devices and device credentials. Cumulocity cannot be held liable for any leaked credentials from devices. The customer acknowledges that communication protocols and ciphers may require periodic updates to address evolving security threats. This may necessitate updates to the devices themselves.
* **End user access security:** To protect the integrity of the cloud platform, customers are encouraged to educate their users on secure usage practices, such as implementing multi-factor authentication. The customer is responsible for managing user credentials, and Cumulocity cannot be held responsible for any compromised credentials.
* **Certificate management:** The customer is responsible for monitoring the expiration of their certificates. Expired certificates can result in service unavailability for the associated clients, and the customer expressly acknowledges this responsibility.
* **Library updates:** Customers utilizing Cumulocity-provided libraries to build their own applications are responsible for ensuring these libraries are kept up to date with respect to security. In the event of a security vulnerability or other critical update, it is the customer's responsibility to implement the necessary updates in their applications to maintain the integrity and security of their systems. Cumulocity cannot be held liable for any security issues arising from outdated libraries in customer applications.

##### **Capacity management**

* **Scalability considerations:** While the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform is designed to be scalable, it may not be able to accommodate sudden, extreme capacity demands (e.g., all devices attempting to connect simultaneously after a connectivity outage, or all devices being upgraded at the same time). The customer acknowledges that such requests may be delayed or declined by the platform to maintain overall service stability. The customer is advised to implement an [exponential backoff strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff).
* **Soft limits:** The customer acknowledges the existence of "soft limits" as documented in the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} documentation [here](/concepts/limits/). These limits are not strictly enforced but exceeding them may lead to a reduced service level, and the customer is advised to operate within these guidelines.
* **Data retention management:** Data storage is included as part of the customer’s subscription. The customer is responsible for configuring appropriate data retention rules within the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Administration application, balancing their specific use case requirements with budgetary considerations.

For details on non-permitted uses of {{< product-c8y-iot >}}, please refer to the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Terms of Service.

### Limitations and constraints

In the interest of transparency and to ensure a mutual understanding of the service capabilities, we kindly ask customers to acknowledge the following limitations and constraints of the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform:

* **Hard quotas:** The customer acknowledges the existence of hard quotas as detailed in the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} documentation [here](/concepts/limits/). These quotas define maximum thresholds that the platform can support and are essential for maintaining overall system stability.
* **Shared environment considerations:** Customers not utilizing {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Dedicated plans should be aware that their tenant is hosted within a shared environment. As a result, response times may occasionally vary due to shared resource usage, and the customer acknowledges this potential inconsistency. Furthermore, infrastructure-level information such as HTTP or MQTT access logs cannot be shared with Customers.
* **Data retention and storage costs:** The customer acknowledges that reducing data retention periods does not immediately lead to the reclamation of storage space or a reduction in storage costs due to technical processing requirements.
* **Distributed IoT system:** The customer acknowledges that IoT systems, by nature, are distributed and Internet-based:
    * **Connectivity reliability:** Connectivity may occasionally fail. To ensure reliable communication, customer devices and clients should implement appropriate reconnect or retry strategies. Singular connection drops or temporary failures are considered normal and do not constitute a service failure. Cumulocity is committed to working with the customer to troubleshoot and resolve consistent and repeating communication issues.
    * **Third-party connectivity services:** Connectivity may involve third-party services such as LPWAN or mobile network operators. The customer acknowledges that while Cumulocity facilitates the transfer of data through these services, it does not operate, monitor, or troubleshoot these third-party networks. Connectivity between the customer's devices and {{< product-c8y-iot >}} cloud service is in the sole responsibility of the customer.
* **Data recovery**: While Cumulocity maintains backups of data for its own business continuity management, disaster recovery on behalf of Customers (e.g., after accidental data deletion by Customers) is a separate service. Customer expressly acknowledges the backup retention period and RPO outline above.

### Service availability

Cumulocity is committed to providing reliable service. The specific service availability targets are as follows:

* **Production environments:** 99.90% availability
* **Preproduction environments:** 95.00% availability

Service availability for {{< product-c8y-iot >}} is calculated as follows:

* The platform service consists of the service components "API Services" (REST) and "MQTT Services" as shown on the status page of the respective platform.
* The service components are regularly tested for availability and performance by simulating typical usage.
* The service availability of the service component for a month is the share of minutes the service component is available, excluding planned downtimes and emergency maintenance.
* The overall service availability is the average of the service components.

For non-production instances, the following are also excluded from the availability calculation:

(a) **Planned and announced maintenance tasks:** These may include, but are not limited to:

* Installation and upgrades of the entire platform.
* Deployment of new components.
* Upgrades to underlying third-party components (e.g., Kubernetes, Database systems).

(b) **Third-party platform issues:** Any issues with the underlying computing platforms (e.g., Azure, AWS) that result in service unavailability are excluded from the availability calculations.

(c) **Events of force majeure**.

The status pages showing the service availability results are at

* [status.cumulocity.com](http://status.cumulocity.com) for US and EMEA instances.
* [cumulocity-apj.statuspage.io](http://cumulocity-apj.statuspage.io) for APJ instances.
* a dedicated location for {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Dedicated instances.

Planned and unplanned downtimes for the Cloud Services are communicated via the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} status page, which will also provide an expected time for the system’s return to availability. Please note that the availability of the status page itself is not included in the Cloud Service availability calculations.
